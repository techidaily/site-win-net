It removes any spaces or other characters other than alpha numeric, data, so that all of the alpha numberic is moved to the far left.

(The plugin is used so frequently, that I’m currently taking my text editing home to do it on my 32 bit version of EmEditor, where I have the plugin, rather than attempting to do it at work where the plugin is not available.)

 If you want to remove space or tabs in less than 4 or 8 columns in the left side of each lines, I would just press SHIFT + TAB after you select lines. Does this help?

I've been using a [standing desk](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/best-standing-desks/) for over a decade. I find the flexibility and benefits far outweigh the [traditional desk setup](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/how-to-choose-the-right-monitor-layout-for-work/). But because I already push my legs to their limits with running, cycling, and rowing, I find that I have to switch between standing and sitting to keep my calves, thighs, and feet from suffering under the weight of a constant upright position.

When sitting, it's always helpful to have something to prop your feet on. I've tried just about everything to accommodate this -- from small crates to basic metal frames, and anything that was the right height -- but eventually discovered a purpose-built piece of hardware, made by a company called Vivo. 

This [little footstool](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0763RMV58%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6efef426-cdaf-412d-bf55-33f091c9bd73%7Cdtp&dtb=1) has made my seated time at my standing desk exponentially more comfortable, even when training for a marathon. My legs thank me for the rest at every opportunity.

## The specs

The Vivo standing footrest is the ideal option, not only because it's made of sturdy steel, but because it's also adjustable, has a felt-like cover on the platform, and no-slip textured metal feet to prevent the stool from sliding about.

* Dimensions - 15.7 x 10.1 x 5 inches, platform size - 9.8" x 15.7"
* Frame - Steel that is backed with a 3-year manufacturer warranty
* Handle - Padded handle can be used to carry the stool or as a second option for foot placement
* Cost - [$50](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0763RMV58%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6efef426-cdaf-412d-bf55-33f091c9bd73%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

I use the stool whether I'm sitting or standing. When standing, I randomly switch legs and will either place a foot on the platform or the handle (most often, the platform). This makes for a very comfortable bit of relief as I stand throughout the day. 

The Vivo footrest has six different height adjustment placement points.

## Why you should buy one

First off, I've been extolling the benefits of standing desks for some time now. After being at my desk for hours on end, I never feel the same weight of exhaustion I used to feel when seated all day. But having such an effective footstool with a small footprint is a huge benefit. 

Truth be told, however, this footstool isn't just a benefit to those who use a [standing desk](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0763RMV58%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6efef426-cdaf-412d-bf55-33f091c9bd73%7Cdtp&dtb=1). Even if you use a traditional seated desk, this stool would be a great addition (especially if you're of the shorter persuasion like me). Either way, the Vivo footstool can give your legs and feet some much-needed relief.

Another bonus of the Vivo footrest is that it's incredibly simple to put together. With only three pieces: the feet, platform, and handle, it doesn't even require any tools for assembly.

Personally, I cannot imagine not having this footstool under me. Without it, I struggled to find something that was the perfect height for me so that I could either use my monopod stool or offer each leg a bit of relief as I stand. One final benefit of this footstool is that it makes the transition from standing to sitting incredibly easy. And at just [under $50](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0763RMV58%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6efef426-cdaf-412d-bf55-33f091c9bd73%7Cdtp&dtb=1), this gem should be considered a must-buy for anyone who sits or stands at a desk for long periods of time.

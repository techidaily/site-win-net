## Spotizr Down? Here's How to Fix It and a Top-Notch Free Substitute You Can Download Today!

### Overview

Spotify and Deezer are two different music streaming services. Music fans may subscribe these two music services and these users may want to combine the playlists from these two services into one. Spotizr just serves this purpose.

Simply speaking, Spotizr is a playlist converter which is used to convert Spotify playlists to Deezer playlists by importing Spotify playlist URL and syncing it to Deezer. But many users are reporting that Spotizr includes many bugs and sometimes Spotizr does not work to help to transfer the Spotify playlists to Deezer playlists. So want to use another software to listen to Spotify playlists on Deezer? If so, a Spotizr alternative - Allavsoft can help you.

### Spotizr Alternative - Allavsoft
